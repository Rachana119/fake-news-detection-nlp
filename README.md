# 📰 Fake News Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **NLP-based Fake News Detection system** that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using **Machine Learning techniques**. The system analyzes both the **headline and full article text**, extracts meaningful linguistic features, and predicts the authenticity of news content.  
To enhance transparency, the project also includes **Explainable AI**, highlighting key words that influenced the model’s decision.

The application is deployed as an **interactive web application using Streamlit**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fake news using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Apply **Machine Learning** for text classification
- Improve prediction accuracy using **headline + article context**
- Provide **Explainable AI** for model interpretability
- Deploy a user-friendly **Streamlit web application**

---

## 🧠 How the Project Works
1. User enters a **news headline** and **full article**
2. Text is **cleaned and preprocessed**
3. Text is converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF**
4. A trained **Logistic Regression model** predicts Fake or Real
5. **Explainable AI** displays influential words affecting prediction
6. Final result and confidence score are shown to the user

## ⚠️ Important Note
> This model predicts based on **linguistic patterns** learned from news articles.  
> It does **not verify factual correctness**.  
> Best results are obtained using **full-length news articles**.
